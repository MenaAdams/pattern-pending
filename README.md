# Pattern Pending

## Summary
Pattern Pending is a Ravelry client that interfaces with Ravelry's API for users to easily browse knitting patterns and view user statistics in cute doughnut charts. I made Pattern Pending because I'm a knitter who loves to browse patterns but found Ravelry's interface unintuitive for that purpose. I wanted to highlight what makes Ravelry exciting to me.
